# QuotesApp-JWoC
Project for JWoC.<br>

## 🎯 **Project Objective**
*We would be building an app to display random quotes fetched using my own [quotescraper API](https://github.com/Ly0kami/quotescraper) from scratch via this project, block by block and with additional cool features.*

This project is aimed to get the mentees accustomed with the ins and outs of basic Android development.

The major focus here would be
- 📱 *Good UI/UX:* Focusing over Functionality and Form alike.
- ⚙️ *Activity handling:* Exploring more about the core of android apps, activities.
- 🌐 *API integration:* Learning how to utilise an internet hosted data source, such as an API, and extract the required information to put to use in the app.
